    "title": "Project",
    "desc": "This project, developed in the European Information Technology Department at WEGeuro S.A., arose from the need to replace static org charts that were manually updated. Thus, an <strong>interactive org chart in Power BI</strong> was implemented, presenting WEG’s organizational structure in real time. The fully responsive solution works on both desktop and mobile devices, integrates department search functionality, and allows immediate contact with any employee via direct email or Microsoft Teams link. The org chart visually distinguishes directors, managers, supervisors and employees, facilitating the identification of roles and sections. By replacing manual diagrams, it eliminated update tasks, reduced the time spent searching for internal information and reinforced transparency and communication within the organization, leveraging advanced data visualization practices in Power BI and DAX."
